- typing: { issueId, isTyping }
- comment: { issueId, content }

Server → Client:
- authenticated: { userId }
- comment-added: { comment }
- status-changed: { issueId, status }
- user-typing: { userId, isTyping }
```

### 5.3 Database Schema Design

#### Optimizations
```
Indexes:
- employees(email, emp_id) - Login performance
- issues(status, created_at) - Filtering
- issues(employee_id) - User's issues
- comments(issue_id) - Comment loading

Constraints:
- Foreign keys with CASCADE
- Check constraints for enums
- Unique constraints for business rules
```

### 5.4 Security Implementation

#### Authentication Flow
```
1. User submits credentials
2. Server validates against database
3. Generate JWT token (24h expiry)
4. Client stores in localStorage
5. Include in Authorization header
6. Server validates on each request
```

#### Security Headers
```javascript
app.use(helmet({
  contentSecurityPolicy: {
    directives: {
      defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
      styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
      scriptSrc: ["'self'"],
      imgSrc: ["'self'", "data:", "https:"],
    },
  },
  hsts: {
    maxAge: 31536000,
    includeSubDomains: true,
  },
